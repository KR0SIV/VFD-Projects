Here contains a list of VFD projects
(VFD customer pole, screen)

Each project folder contains it's own readme with it's own dependancies, some also have a windows exe.
Note that each project (unless you run the exe) requires the 'dumbvfd' gem.

gem install dumbvfd

The above will install dumbvfd and it's dependancies.
